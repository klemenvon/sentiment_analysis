FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves with this one\\u2014like they handed Picasso a game engine and said, \\\"Make something that'll make people cry.\\\" And boy, does it make you cry rivers.\\n\\nThe graphics? [b]Stunning.[/b] Seriously, I\\u2019ve spent more time staring at the sunset over Limgrave than actually playing the game. The landscapes are so breathtakingly beautiful that every time I respawn after dying to some random frog or pot-wielding grandma, I feel like I\\u2019m in an art gallery where someone keeps punching me in the face. It\\u2019s poetic. Truly poetic.\\n\\nAnd the gameplay? Stellar. The combat system is tight, responsive, and deeply satisfying when you finally nail that perfect parry against a giant knight who's been curb-stomping you for hours. Every victory feels earned, even if it took me 47 tries to beat a tree stump that might have been sentient. There\\u2019s just something magical about going from \\u201cI hate everything\\u201d to \\u201cI am the Elden Lord!\\u201d in under five seconds.\\n\\nNow let\\u2019s talk about the difficulty. Oh, sweet merciful heavens, this game is brutal. But here\\u2019s the twist\\u2014it\\u2019s fun! Like, really fun. Sure, I\\u2019ve screamed at my screen more times than I can count because yet another invisible skeleton decided to ruin my day, but there\\u2019s always this little voice inside me saying, \\u201cCome on, you got this!\\u201d [i]Spoiler alert: I didn\\u2019t get this.[/i] Not most of the time anyway. But hey, dying is half the experience, right? [i]Right?![/i]\\n\\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring is a love letter to gamers who enjoy being humbled by their own incompetence while marveling at jaw-dropping visuals and flawless mechanics. If you\\u2019re looking for a challenge that\\u2019ll test your patience, skill, and will to live, look no further. Just be prepared to lose a few hundred hours of your life\\u2014and possibly your sanity\\u2014to a video game that somehow makes failure feel rewarding.\",\n",

It is a classic soulslike game the plus is you got all variant and playstyle. While DS series seems to be a melee based combat, at least for me. Elden ring step up so magic, melee, bow, etc playable. \\n\\nTLDR : git gud for me\\n\\n[h2] What can be improved?[/h2]\\nI would say that i crazily simp for Rya. Kinda dissapointing that they don't include Rya ending's. This alone make the game a  9/10. Hopefully they do an update to include Rya as one of the ending.\",\n",

I was a bit skeptical about it, but everything changed as soon as I started the game.\\n\\nThe game felt hard at the beginning, but once you understand what needs to be done, how the combat mechanics work, and study the difficult bosses after a few deaths, it becomes much more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe universe FromSoftware created is beautiful, with great level design and well-crafted bosses. There are a few repetitive dungeons, areas, and bosses, and at times the game feels a bit stretched, but I can tolerate that because it's not overdone.\\n\\nThere is a huge variety of builds and weapons, which is very useful if you plan to have more than one playthrough. On top of that, the game offers a vast number of hidden collectibles and secrets.\\n\\nIt's a very special game, and I would highly recommend it to action-adventure RPG lovers. This isn't structured exactly like previous Souls games, you have a massive open-world map with stunning locations and excellent level design.\",\n",

If you don't, you have options to make life easier. This game gives you the tools to tailor the game to your preferences and you should use things as you see fit. \\r\\nThe gameplay is a bit stiff and clunky. Kind of like an indie title using stock plugins. Not bad so much as needing an adjustment period. The graphics are nothing special and the pacing glacial.\\r\\nWhat this game has going against it, however, pales in comparison to the whole. As a package, it's so, so hard to dislike this. The atmosphere keeps you hooked, the design of the spaces makes you cautious, yet still willing to push on. Any setbacks you have can be put off while you work on getting stronger and still engaging with the game fully. The side quests are not, they are all integral to the whole.\\r\\nTruly a game that is not for everybody, yet appealing to so, so many. Some people may put you off, but please remember that your game is yours. Play it how you enjoy it.\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"I really enjoyed my time in this game. I spent about 400 hours on a _single_ playthrough, and not a moment of it felt like it dragged or overstayed its welcome, nor did the hours matter at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe landscapes were gorgeous and unique, each one filled me with a tapestry of emotions \\u2014 curiosity, dread, expectation, apprehension, anticipation, excitement, fear, the whole gamut. It's a unique mix that I haven't experienced in other games. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe world constantly unveiled surprises around every corner, and the game would have a subtle way of defying the things I would begin to treat as expected; just when I think I've managed to 'figure out' a certain enemy type or a zone, a new variation is thrown at me that I have to overcome. \\r\\n\\r\\nConquering these challenges felt rewarding, but right away became a baseline setup for the next challenge to overcome. I realize a lot of this is quite abstract and intangible but I had to express it, and I see the other reviews also trying to do the same thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe type of environment that really appeals to me is being alone (I don't like playing with others), I like rich fantasy landscapes, I like castles and dungeons, ruins, exploring, finding secrets. This world gives me all of that. There's a pervasive sense of exploration and loneliness, within a realm that is hostile and beautiful. The accompanying music is often tenuous and haunting, enhancing the atmospheric experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other really nice thing about the game, is I can play it and 'beat' it in so many different ways. There are so many tools available and it's entirely up to me whether to use or ignore them, and that makes for a unique playthrough. There are dozens of weapons, armor types, spells, skills, summons, recipes. I simply chose the playstyle that I liked the most. I didn't really go for consumables, but I did like summons. I found lots of cool looking weapons, but only the pickaxe felt the best to me, the way it just smacks the enemies down with absolute piercing authority.\",\n",

With horseback combat, vast landscapes, and an endless variety of builds, Elden Ring redefined the boundaries of what a Souls game could be. While some critics felt that certain bosses were overly aggressive compared to past titles, the sheer scope and ambition of the game made it an instant classic, widely regarded as one of the best games of the decade.\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"Welcome to the Lands Between, Tarnished...\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an amazing Soulsborne you should play at least once in your life. But if you are worried about the difficulty, don't think about it too hard, but it is recommended to have some kind of experience in challenging games. This game can be much more generous on difficulty compared to other Soulsbornes, especially with the completely optional summons you can use to help you fight, and the open-world factor allowing you to come back later if things are too difficult. That doesn't mean it's easy though. But if you are tempted to use summons near the of your journey, I recommend at least trying to learn and get the combat down before instantly resorting to the assist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter you (hopefully) completed the tutorial found right after the very beginning of the game, you'll be met with a beautiful site and the world this game takes place in, \\\"the Lands Between.\\\" The beginning of your journey may seem confusing, but once you start exploring you'll find many areas and things to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combat in this game is simple but challenging. But one of the most crucial parts is the dodging. (As with pretty much all Soulsbornes.) Even if you can do some good damage, if you're getting hit every 5-10 seconds, you aren't going to get very far. Trial and error is a part of the game you will experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bosses in this game are very good as well. All the main bosses are very unique and fun to fight. (Aside from the possible rage inducing moments you may experience.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne minor issue though is that the NPC quests in this game can be very confusing and sometimes feel extremely difficult to do without a guide online. Another thing is that there is no quest log for any NPCs. So if you start a quest with an NPC, you have to remember it or talk to them again if they are in the same spot to get them to tell you what to do again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, this game isn't perfect by any means. It has some minor flaws. But they don't really take much away from the overall experience. This game is a really good one I recommend if you're looking for a challenging and polished game experience.\",\n",

The challenging bosses, the relentless hellscape you are placed in, the unforgiving & lack of coddling that people get so used to while playing games. These sound like they should be cons, but they are some of the games strengths in immersing you in an experience that you cannot find elsewhere. An introductory guide would definitely be needed to figure out your bearings in the beginning, but once you figure that out, I believe this game could easily be one of the best you could ever play. \\n\\nOnce you get into the game, do not be discouraged in the difficulty of the bosses you meet in the Lands Between, but keep on going. This game rewards perseverance, so remain persistent and you shall be rewarded. \\n\\nDon't forget to also explore the magnificent and beautiful world that the Lands Between is.\",\n",

I was a bit skeptical about it, but everything changed as soon as I started the game.\\n\\nThe game felt hard at the beginning, but once you understand what needs to be done, how the combat mechanics work, and study the difficult bosses after a few deaths, it becomes much more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe universe FromSoftware created is beautiful, with great level design and well-crafted bosses. There are a few repetitive dungeons, areas, and bosses, and at times the game feels a bit stretched, but I can tolerate that because it's not overdone.\\n\\nThere is a huge variety of builds and weapons, which is very useful if you plan to have more than one playthrough. On top of that, the game offers a vast number of hidden collectibles and secrets.\\n\\nIt's a very special game, and I would highly recommend it to action-adventure RPG lovers. This isn't structured exactly like previous Souls games, you have a massive open-world map with stunning locations and excellent level design.\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"Overall, I'm binning the game and moving on because I'm simply not enjoying it enough. I understand that a lot of my complaints apply to the Soulsborne series as a whole, so it seems pretty clear that the series is not for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like that just about every mob can be a real threat and should be treated as such, and that you really have to be conscious about not letting yourself get surrounded. Some of the special weapon moves can feel really satisfying if pulled off. But that's about the last good thing I have to say about the combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, I think the controls just feel too jank for what the game demands of you, especially against the bosses. Dodge rolling feels VERY inconsistent, as does whether or not my character will decide to drink their health potion when I press the button. I really hated getting stunlocked by bosses too. I get that part of the challenge is avoiding the initial hit that leads to the combo, but it made me feel helpless, rather than motivating me to improve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jank also extends to the exploration. The platforming feels absolutely awful, whether on foot or on horseback. The amount of times where it was literally the intended path to take a risky-looking jump off an innocuous-looking ledge bordered on absurd. It's crazy to me that a game that advertises its open world as including an interesting amount of verticality would contain no climbing mechanics or ways to interact with ledges besides awkwardly running off them. It was equally crazy to me that fast travel was the only way out of the Leonine Misbegotten arena. Actively requiring fast travel because there's no other way to exit an area feels like a violation of the open world promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe runes/souls system for levelling up and shopping is of course excellent, though the corpse running mechanic feels like it makes a lot less sense in an open world game as opposed to earlier, linear entries. Nothing discourages exploration like returning to the same area over and over again. I feel that the improvements I got from levelling up were far too granular, and I never really felt any more powerful leaving a Site of Grace because I saw a number increase from 103 to 105.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy final gripe is the way in which information is presented. NPCs speaking in cryptic riddles can be cool for dishing out lore, but I shouldn't be able to accept a quest and have no idea what I've actually been asked to do. I'm sure I won't be the first to complain that there is no quest log, which seems to be a pointlessly stubborn decision for a game of this scale. The menus are horrendous to navigate, and make very little sense. The game does not seem at all interested in teaching you its mechanics either. Most of what I learned was from wikis and Reddit posts, because the game was too obtuse to give me the info I needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of this is a huge shame, because I really wanted to like the game. I was excited to see what all the fuss was about. It feels like this would be an incredible experience for anyone who already loves the Souls series, but it was just too hostile for this hapless first-timer.\",\n",

Its wonderfully mystical but shamelessly unfair. \\n\\nMy frustrations with the game can be summed up as \\\"rules for thee but not for me.\\\" Bosses like Maliketh and Margott keep on jumping around, retreating and relentlessly attacks like they have infinite stamina; enemies like the Royal Revenant, Misbegottens, Azula Beastmen and Banished Knights can also attack overly-aggressively and endlessly. NPC enemies like Bernahl, Vyke and Okina can hyper armor through your attacks and retaliate almost immediately after you flinch them. Them and regular enemies have infinite FP to spam as much spells and art of wars as they want. Glintstone Sorcerers are annoying for this reason paired with always coming in groups. Cast speed can also be lightning fast like how the Night's Cavalry can call back their horse faster than your fist weapons can land. Landing hits or punishes can be annoying with your toothpick-like range and given how agile bosses are like Gargoyles, Maliketh and even Loretta with how often they move around with their horse. Boss' also being bigger than you means they always have a larger range than you paired with generous tracking to catch you. \\n\\nThe game simply sides with the enemies and bosses, even when they're NPCs with player-esque models. Meanwhile you're still dealing with stamina, bestowed a singular jump button as a pittance and the Dark Wood Grain Ring hasn't been seen since Dark Souls I. You get interrupted out of your attack by a sneeze. Can't even land projectiles like the kukri half the time since many enemies are programmed to auto-dodge and the lock-on is straight up unreliable for moving enemies. Even when dumping stats into stamina, your combo ends and recovers while enemies can (again) keep relentlessly attacking. You'll just find yourself being knocked around like a paddle-ball regardless of damage taken, having to heal and then it happening all over again due to input-read. Draconic Tree Sentinel will just keep spitting fireballs if you heal; Ancient Dragons swing and spam lightning to knock you around a lot. The Attacks that seem like they have adequate recovery to punish the enemies are actually bait so enemies can follow-up to punish you trying to punish them; if you don't punish, they'll just not do anything and recover. I'm looking at you Margit. \\\"You don't get to punish. Only I get to punish and play the game\\\" kind of despicable attitude. You'll just be gaslit by the game or its advocates to not be 'greedy,' despite being a starving child compared to what the enemies and bosses are fed. \\n\\nAnd yet I can't help but keep playing this game. The unremarkable rpg damage numbers when spamming my spike balls or twin knight's resolve Giant-Crusher jumping r2 make my monkey brain go \\\"UGH UGH.\\\" Still recommend if you've never played it before...\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"Okay, after 3 years, I have finally beat elden ring in less than 2 weeks. and here is my constructive criticism about the game. I have a love and hate relationship with elden ring, but end up with loving the game more than hating apparently, because I keep playing it.\\n\\nThe game itself has alot of content and if you want to, you can be combat ready for NG+ as it's getting harder over time. (NG+ 1 was mad easy than you start the very NG if you tell me) The game has left with good and very challanging content and makes the gameplay quite difficult. So here we go to the constructive criticism.\\n\\n1. The map is so HUGE that the delevopers must be delusional to not add guides in the game itself on where to go, what quests are nearby and what quests you can accept. I have looked up a gazilion times on youtube and google for guides on where to go, because the game doesn't offer me that which left me 3 years of not playing the game.\\n\\n2. All bosses have input reading which is basically an AI added feature in the boss that reads your average combat style and knows exactly when to counter your attacks and the moments to heal.\\n\\n3. the traditional fromsoft dodges are very unforgiving. The ''dodge'' has exactly 1 second to dodge projectiles and attacks, so learning how to dodge is based the attacks on the enemy. The AOE's on some bosses are so overpowered that some of them aren't even dodgable and then you will end up dead eventually.\\n\\n4. Bosses with delay attacks. I've said enough.\",\n",

Kind of like an indie title using stock plugins. Not bad so much as needing an adjustment period. The graphics are nothing special and the pacing glacial.\\r\\nWhat this game has going against it, however, pales in comparison to the whole. As a package, it's so, so hard to dislike this.

I spent about 400 hours on a _single_ playthrough, and not a moment of it felt like it dragged or overstayed its welcome, nor did the hours matter at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe landscapes were gorgeous and unique, each one filled me with a tapestry of emotions \\u2014 curiosity, dread, expectation, apprehension, anticipation, excitement, fear, the whole gamut. It's a unique mix that I haven't experienced in other games. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe world constantly unveiled surprises around every corner, and the game would have a subtle way of defying the things I would begin to treat as expected; just when I think I've managed to 'figure out' a certain enemy type or a zone, a new variation is thrown at me that I have to overcome. \\r\\n\\r\\nConquering these challenges felt rewarding, but right away became a baseline setup for the next challenge to overcome. I realize a lot of this is quite abstract and intangible but I had to express it, and I see the other reviews also trying to do the same thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe type of environment that really appeals to me is being alone (I don't like playing with others), I like rich fantasy landscapes, I like castles and dungeons, ruins, exploring, finding secrets. This world gives me all of that. There's a pervasive sense of exploration and loneliness, within a realm that is hostile and beautiful. The accompanying music is often tenuous and haunting, enhancing the atmospheric experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other really nice thing about the game, is I can play it and 'beat' it in so many different ways. There are so many tools available and it's entirely up to me whether to use or ignore them, and that makes for a unique playthrough. There are dozens of weapons, armor types, spells, skills, summons, recipes. I simply chose the playstyle that I liked the most. I didn't really go for consumables, but I did like summons. I found lots of cool looking weapons, but only the pickaxe felt the best to me, the way it just smacks the enemies down with absolute piercing authority.\",\n",

FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves with this one\\u2014like they handed Picasso a game engine and said, \\\"Make something that'll make people cry.\\\" And boy, does it make you cry rivers.\\n\\nThe graphics? [b]Stunning.[/b] Seriously, I\\u2019ve spent more time staring at the sunset over Limgrave than actually playing the game. The landscapes are so breathtakingly beautiful that every time I respawn after dying to some random frog or pot-wielding grandma, I feel like I\\u2019m in an art gallery where someone keeps punching me in the face. It\\u2019s poetic. Truly poetic.\\n\\nAnd the gameplay? Stellar. The combat system is tight, responsive, and deeply satisfying when you finally nail that perfect parry against a giant knight who's been curb-stomping you for hours. Every victory feels earned, even if it took me 47 tries to beat a tree stump that might have been sentient. There\\u2019s just something magical about going from \\u201cI hate everything\\u201d to \\u201cI am the Elden Lord!\\u201d in under five seconds.\\n\\nNow let\\u2019s talk about the difficulty. Oh, sweet merciful heavens, this game is brutal. But here\\u2019s the twist\\u2014it\\u2019s fun! Like, really fun. Sure, I\\u2019ve screamed at my screen more times than I can count because yet another invisible skeleton decided to ruin my day, but there\\u2019s always this little voice inside me saying, \\u201cCome on, you got this!\\u201d [i]Spoiler alert: I didn\\u2019t get this.[/i] Not most of the time anyway. But hey, dying is half the experience, right? [i]Right?![/i]\\n\\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring is a love letter to gamers who enjoy being humbled by their own incompetence while marveling at jaw-dropping visuals and flawless mechanics. If you\\u2019re looking for a challenge that\\u2019ll test your patience, skill, and will to live, look no further. Just be prepared to lose a few hundred hours of your life\\u2014and possibly your sanity\\u2014to a video game that somehow makes failure feel rewarding.\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"What a game! Just completed main story. DLC later, so this will cover only the main game.\\nI'll keep things spoiler-free or be intentionally vague to make my point without telling the details.\\nMy first blind playthrough, no guides, except for some info on NPC quests, mouse and keyboard.\\n\\n[h2]Elden Ring - main game[/h2]\\n[h3]Positives - First off, joy![/h3]\\n- Lets talk about the elephant in the game - open world. This is a first in FromSoft souls games and it brings mostly positives, but also a couple of blunders, more on those later. This open world is so much better than in most other such games, because it allows and encourages you to find things on your own, you only get a small hint on the direction in which the main story is going and after that you decide your adventure, no question marks on the map, no outposts, no busy work lame activities. Just exploration, beautiful views everywhere and deadly fights. Oh and the flow is seamless, because you don't need to run back and forth to \\\"take on a mission\\\", then slowly get to the destination for things to start happening, in Elden Ring events happen as you go and you return to hub only when you want to.\\n- Level designers went nuts this time, the big castle you encounter early on was so massive and cleverly designed that I felt a bit overwhelmed and took my sweet time to look in every corner of it and was not disappointed, clearly THE best castle design I've ever seen in a game. Later on it was surpassed by the city, but that location I think was actually a bit too much, though I still enjoyed it. If you have topographical cretinism you're gonna be in trouble.\\n- A lot of spectacular boss fights, one of them went straight into my top 3 of all FromSoft souls games.\\n- Many weapons, arts, summons, magic to choose from, so everyone will find something to their liking.\\n- Amazing art design, with HDR enabled this game looks like every frame a painting.\\n- Controls are fine, I've always played with M&K, so only dedicated jumping button was new to me. I've put jumping on a side button on the mouse, disabled the auto panning of the camera and got gud pretty quickly after that, thanks to the Erdtree Sentry (golden knight).\\n\\n[h3]Negatives - Why is it always dung?[/h3]\\n- NPC stories and quests were always vague in souls games and this time the vast open world only exacerbated the issue. Previous games were smaller and more linear, so if you were paying attention you'd probably cover many of the quests and even complete some of them, in Elden ring there could be tens of hours between quest starting point and its next step, if you are like me and take your time exploring. By that time you'll probably forget who was that NPC or what they wanted, there is no log to keep track, so you either take notes yourself or consult a wiki, which is lame, I hate doing that, but in this case it's almost mandatory. You could also go somewhere the game didn't thought you'd go so early and trigger some events that will skip a lot of steps in the stories. There are also hidden triggers of which you have no idea and so on. It's a mess. I miraculously found out some of the events by pure luck and that's me being thorough.\\n- Boss fights quantity over quality and the challenge aspect. Another issue of the open world pattern. Some of them are repeating a lot with minor changes. They are like filler bosses. After the first major boss before entering the castle, Elden Ring somewhat loses its challenge aspect in boss fights until the last 20% of the game and the infamous Malenia with her FUCKING combo, seriously, that would be a fantastic boss, but that one cheap combo she does is infuriating. Other than that it was a good fight and the second one after the first major boss where I had to be fully focused to overcome. I died here a lot. A few other bosses were also difficult, but nowhere near these two, at least for me.\\n- 60 FPS lock, no ultrawide support, funny thing is game does indeed support ultrawide, but they added black bars on the sides for some unknown reason \\u00af\\\\_(\\u30c4)_/\\u00af, sometimes game can freeze for 2 seconds, I couldn't figure out why, setting graphics to low didn't help, tried many things, but then it goes away... so yeah, weird. There are mods for the fps and ultrawide, but that would require to play offline and I love the online aspect of the game, talking about messages, bloodstains, invasions.\\n\\n[h3]Nitpicks - Could this be a dog?[/h3]\\n- Dragons are a joke, while fighting the first one was cool and intimidating, I soon found out that they pose little to no threat compared to how they are in other souls games. There are basically two dragons worth the title in the whole game, every other hundred of them are filthy drakes that have a lot of roar and no bite.\\n- If you play solo, you're not going to be invaded by real players, unless you use a specific item. This is lame and ruins that \\\"oh shit\\\" moment when the invasion happens in the worst time and puts you in a pickle and creates some memorable moments of glory or defeat. I'd prefer it to be the other way around - you need to use an item in order to not be invaded.\\n- You can respec your character stats, but you can't do the same with your weapons. This restricts my experimentation and makes me basically commit to a weapon or two based on moveset till the very late stages of the game, unless you want to sit on a wiki with an excel spreadsheet open or simply follow someone's guide, which I don't want to do for my first run, very annoying.\\n- I was bashing every chest, but no mimics were found! What the hell FromSoftware?\\n\\n[h3]Conclusion - Try jumping[/h3]\\nHaving said all that I had incredible time playing Elden Ring and most of my negs and nitpicks are just souls-vet whining, I do love the game and would wholeheartedly recommend it, even if it's your first game in this genre.\\n\\n9/10\\n\\n\\n[h2]DLC - You don't have the right, O you don't have the right![/h2]\\nTo be concluded...\",\n",

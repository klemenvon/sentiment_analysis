FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves with this one\\u2014like they handed Picasso a game engine and said, \\\"Make something that'll make people cry.\\\" And boy, does it make you cry rivers.\\n\\nThe graphics? [b]Stunning.[/b] Seriously, I\\u2019ve spent more time staring at the sunset over Limgrave than actually playing the game. The landscapes are so breathtakingly beautiful that every time I respawn after dying to some random frog or pot-wielding grandma, I feel like I\\u2019m in an art gallery where someone keeps punching me in the face. It\\u2019s poetic. Truly poetic.\\n\\nAnd the gameplay? Stellar. The combat system is tight, responsive, and deeply satisfying when you finally nail that perfect parry against a giant knight who's been curb-stomping you for hours. Every victory feels earned, even if it took me 47 tries to beat a tree stump that might have been sentient. There\\u2019s just something magical about going from \\u201cI hate everything\\u201d to \\u201cI am the Elden Lord!\\u201d in under five seconds.\\n\\nNow let\\u2019s talk about the difficulty. Oh, sweet merciful heavens, this game is brutal. But here\\u2019s the twist\\u2014it\\u2019s fun! Like, really fun. Sure, I\\u2019ve screamed at my screen more times than I can count because yet another invisible skeleton decided to ruin my day, but there\\u2019s always this little voice inside me saying, \\u201cCome on, you got this!\\u201d [i]Spoiler alert: I didn\\u2019t get this.[/i] Not most of the time anyway. But hey, dying is half the experience, right? [i]Right?![/i]\\n\\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring is a love letter to gamers who enjoy being humbled by their own incompetence while marveling at jaw-dropping visuals and flawless mechanics. If you\\u2019re looking for a challenge that\\u2019ll test your patience, skill, and will to live, look no further. Just be prepared to lose a few hundred hours of your life\\u2014and possibly your sanity\\u2014to a video game that somehow makes failure feel rewarding.\",\n",

It is a classic soulslike game the plus is you got all variant and playstyle. While DS series seems to be a melee based combat, at least for me. Elden ring step up so magic, melee, bow, etc playable. \\n\\nTLDR : git gud for me\\n\\n[h2] What can be improved?[/h2]\\nI would say that i crazily simp for Rya. Kinda dissapointing that they don't include Rya ending's. This alone make the game a  9/10. Hopefully they do an update to include Rya as one of the ending.\",\n",

I was a bit skeptical about it, but everything changed as soon as I started the game.\\n\\nThe game felt hard at the beginning, but once you understand what needs to be done, how the combat mechanics work, and study the difficult bosses after a few deaths, it becomes much more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe universe FromSoftware created is beautiful, with great level design and well-crafted bosses. There are a few repetitive dungeons, areas, and bosses, and at times the game feels a bit stretched, but I can tolerate that because it's not overdone.\\n\\nThere is a huge variety of builds and weapons, which is very useful if you plan to have more than one playthrough. On top of that, the game offers a vast number of hidden collectibles and secrets.\\n\\nIt's a very special game, and I would highly recommend it to action-adventure RPG lovers. This isn't structured exactly like previous Souls games, you have a massive open-world map with stunning locations and excellent level design.\",\n",

If you don't, you have options to make life easier. This game gives you the tools to tailor the game to your preferences and you should use things as you see fit. \\r\\nThe gameplay is a bit stiff and clunky. Kind of like an indie title using stock plugins. Not bad so much as needing an adjustment period. The graphics are nothing special and the pacing glacial.\\r\\nWhat this game has going against it, however, pales in comparison to the whole. As a package, it's so, so hard to dislike this. The atmosphere keeps you hooked, the design of the spaces makes you cautious, yet still willing to push on. Any setbacks you have can be put off while you work on getting stronger and still engaging with the game fully. The side quests are not, they are all integral to the whole.\\r\\nTruly a game that is not for everybody, yet appealing to so, so many. Some people may put you off, but please remember that your game is yours. Play it how you enjoy it.\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"I really enjoyed my time in this game. I spent about 400 hours on a _single_ playthrough, and not a moment of it felt like it dragged or overstayed its welcome, nor did the hours matter at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe landscapes were gorgeous and unique, each one filled me with a tapestry of emotions \\u2014 curiosity, dread, expectation, apprehension, anticipation, excitement, fear, the whole gamut. It's a unique mix that I haven't experienced in other games. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe world constantly unveiled surprises around every corner, and the game would have a subtle way of defying the things I would begin to treat as expected; just when I think I've managed to 'figure out' a certain enemy type or a zone, a new variation is thrown at me that I have to overcome. \\r\\n\\r\\nConquering these challenges felt rewarding, but right away became a baseline setup for the next challenge to overcome. I realize a lot of this is quite abstract and intangible but I had to express it, and I see the other reviews also trying to do the same thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe type of environment that really appeals to me is being alone (I don't like playing with others), I like rich fantasy landscapes, I like castles and dungeons, ruins, exploring, finding secrets. This world gives me all of that. There's a pervasive sense of exploration and loneliness, within a realm that is hostile and beautiful. The accompanying music is often tenuous and haunting, enhancing the atmospheric experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other really nice thing about the game, is I can play it and 'beat' it in so many different ways. There are so many tools available and it's entirely up to me whether to use or ignore them, and that makes for a unique playthrough. There are dozens of weapons, armor types, spells, skills, summons, recipes. I simply chose the playstyle that I liked the most. I didn't really go for consumables, but I did like summons. I found lots of cool looking weapons, but only the pickaxe felt the best to me, the way it just smacks the enemies down with absolute piercing authority.\",\n",

With horseback combat, vast landscapes, and an endless variety of builds, Elden Ring redefined the boundaries of what a Souls game could be. While some critics felt that certain bosses were overly aggressive compared to past titles, the sheer scope and ambition of the game made it an instant classic, widely regarded as one of the best games of the decade.\",\n",

      "            \"review\": \"Welcome to the Lands Between, Tarnished...\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an amazing Soulsborne you should play at least once in your life. But if you are worried about the difficulty, don't think about it too hard, but it is recommended to have some kind of experience in challenging games. This game can be much more generous on difficulty compared to other Soulsbornes, especially with the completely optional summons you can use to help you fight, and the open-world factor allowing you to come back later if things are too difficult. That doesn't mean it's easy though. But if you are tempted to use summons near the of your journey, I recommend at least trying to learn and get the combat down before instantly resorting to the assist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter you (hopefully) completed the tutorial found right after the very beginning of the game, you'll be met with a beautiful site and the world this game takes place in, \\\"the Lands Between.\\\" The beginning of your journey may seem confusing, but once you start exploring you'll find many areas and things to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combat in this game is simple but challenging. But one of the most crucial parts is the dodging. (As with pretty much all Soulsbornes.) Even if you can do some good damage, if you're getting hit every 5-10 seconds, you aren't going to get very far. Trial and error is a part of the game you will experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bosses in this game are very good as well. All the main bosses are very unique and fun to fight. (Aside from the possible rage inducing moments you may experience.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne minor issue though is that the NPC quests in this game can be very confusing and sometimes feel extremely difficult to do without a guide online. Another thing is that there is no quest log for any NPCs. So if you start a quest with an NPC, you have to remember it or talk to them again if they are in the same spot to get them to tell you what to do again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, this game isn't perfect by any means. It has some minor flaws. But they don't really take much away from the overall experience. This game is a really good one I recommend if you're looking for a challenging and polished game experience.\",\n",

The challenging bosses, the relentless hellscape you are placed in, the unforgiving & lack of coddling that people get so used to while playing games. These sound like they should be cons, but they are some of the games strengths in immersing you in an experience that you cannot find elsewhere. An introductory guide would definitely be needed to figure out your bearings in the beginning, but once you figure that out, I believe this game could easily be one of the best you could ever play. \\n\\nOnce you get into the game, do not be discouraged in the difficulty of the bosses you meet in the Lands Between, but keep on going. This game rewards perseverance, so remain persistent and you shall be rewarded. \\n\\nDon't forget to also explore the magnificent and beautiful world that the Lands Between is.\",\n",
